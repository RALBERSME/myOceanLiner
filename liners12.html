                      We had not promised this because we had not implemented
                      this important insight. So it did not matter that we had
                      enough lifeboats, because the lack of equipment meant that
                      most of them could not be used.

                      Yes, we had 600 more than needed. But many passengers did
                      not have one in their hands when the ship sank (more than
                      50%) and those who had one very often did not know how to
                      use it and then put them on incorrectly, so that their
                      effect was useless.
