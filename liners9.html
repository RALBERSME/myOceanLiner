            One day before the passenger steamer Lusitania left New York, a
            German submarine left Emden. U-20

              >(click to read more about U-20) </a
            >, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Walther Schwieger, left
            the harbor in a northwesterly direction. It was to circle the
            British Isles to the north and then take up its designated post in
            the Irish Sea off Liverpool. There it would take up position
            together with other submarines to prevent the British from bringing
            more troops and material to the Dardanelles, from where they planned
            to conquer Istanbul.<br /><br />
            U-20 did not expect an easy mission. The Germans were up against an
            overwhelming enemy at sea - and a warlike one at that. Since the
            outbreak of war in 1914, Great Britain had used merchant ships or
            so-called Q-ships, submarine traps, to hunt for submarines. These
            were old sailing ships that had been converted into decoy ships in
            Queenstown (hence "Q") by installing a camouflaged gun. They were
            designed to give the impression that they were unarmed merchant
            ships

            and to destroy German submarines as soon as they appeared to
            confront the merchant ship.<br />
            In February 1915, Churchill also issued a top-secret instruction to
            British merchant ships to display false national flags to deceive
            the submarines. If they were nevertheless ordered to turn to, they
            were to sink the submarine with a ramming blow. There were also
            plans to set up stern guns.<br />
            <br />Great Britain changes the rules of the game<br /><br />Churchill's
            methods changed centuries-old rules of naval warfare, which the
            Germans had also initially adhered to: According to the old prize
            regulations, no merchant ship could be attacked or sunk without
            ensuring the safety of the civilian crew and passengers. For their
            part, merchant ship captains had to tolerate their ships being
            ordered to turn to or being searched by warships or submarines. The
            protection of civilians also applied in the event that a merchant
            ship adhered to the rules - that is, it did not pretend to be a
            false nationality, nor attempted to ram or use armed resistance. If
            Great Britain changed the rules of the game like this, was the
            "Lusitania" still what it claimed to be?

            On its way to Liverpool, U-20 had attacked several smaller ships and
            some freighters.<br />
            On the evening of January 6, Lieutenant Commander Schwieger decided
            not to continue off Queenstown because of fog. The following day, at
            2:20 p.m., he sighted a ship with four funnels, a large express
            steamer. U-20 dived and set off to intercept.<br /><br />Source: Der
