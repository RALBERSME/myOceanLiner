            In New York, Boston, and Philadelphia newspapers publish warnings
            concerning Americans traveling on British ships through the British
            war zone. The warning states that such ships are liable for
            destruction. Many passengers set to board the Lusitania are alarmed.

        Dear me!<br />
        What`s that?
      </p>
      <p id="decide">
        What do you want to do? Do you believe the rumors in the magazines or do
        you stay on board?<br />
        You heard the captain say that we will be protected by British warships
        as soon as we'll enter English waters. The RMS Lusitania is a fast and
        safe ship.<br />
        You must decide now. The ship will weigh anchor in 30 seconds. If you do
        <u>not</u> want to stay here, click on the newspaper article and your
        journey will be over. <br />Otherwise nothing needs to be done ....we
        will leave in 20 seconds.
