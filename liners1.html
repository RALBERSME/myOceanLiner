        The industrial revolution had led to a sharp increase in
        intercontinental trade since the 19th century. Good and stable shipping
        was needed to ensure this. The invention of steamships made it possible
        to sail independently of the wind. Ships became larger, more robust and
        faster. A competition began which was honoured with the award of the
        <strong class="blue">Blue Riband of the Atlantic</strong>. This is an
        award given to the fastest ship for passengers on the transatlantic
        route Europe - New York and was given from around the 1860s. Well-known
        winners are among others the <strong class="blue">Etruria</strong> and
        the <strong class="blue">Umbria</strong> (both in service from 1885 with
        speeds of around 18 to 19 knots). And also the
        <strong class="blue">Kaiser Wilhelm der Gro√üe</strong> (1897). The
        British sister ships <strong class="blue">Lusitania</strong> and
        <strong class="blue">Mauretania</strong> were commissioned from 1907 and
        were able to defend the Blue Riband until 1929. And many other ships
        received this award... Rumor has it that the Titanic was also keen to
        set a new record and win the Blue Riband on her maiden voyage.<br />
