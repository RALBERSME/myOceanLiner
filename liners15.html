          The sinking of the Lusitania, caused by a torpedo from a German
          submarine, resulted in the deaths of 128 American citizens. This
          generated massive public outrage in the United States and increased
          pressure on then-US President Woodrow Wilson to join the war. The
          sinking of the Lusitania thus contributed significantly to the United
          States' entry into the war. The influence of the sinking of the
          Lusitania on the outcome of the war should therefore not be
          underestimated.<br />Before the Lusitania sank, she sent a distress
          call by radio. The Peel 11 “The Wanderer” fishing boat from the Isle
          of Man was able to rescue between 160 and 200 people. The rescued
          people were brought ashore in Queenstown. The people of Queenstown
          (Ireland) extended sacrificial hospitality and aid to the many
          survivors. Many of the survivors suffered from post-traumatic stress
          syndrome.

              <p>
                There was debate across the United States about how Americans
                should respond. Former President Teddy Roosevelt advocated
                military retaliation and entry into World War I.

                There were many riots against German-run businesses. These are
                called the May 1915 Anti-German Riots, or the Lusitania Riots.

                The captain of the U-20, Walther Schwieger, was initially
                honored. The sinking of the Lusitania was celebrated in Germany.
                Only when people realized how much damage they had done to
                themselves with this apparent victory did they distance
                themselves from Mr. Schwieger.

          A lot has been written and published about the sinking of the
          Lusitania, especially in 2015 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary
          of this event. There are therefore countless documents and reports. I
          have compiled some interesting sources for you here, so that you can
          look up and research even more if you are interested in the topic.

              <p>
                Here you will find facts about the ship and the passengers.
                There are statistics. There is information about the Mixed
                Claims Commission, the Prichard Letters, the Wilson Notes, the
                Mersey Report, but also controversial information. After the
                torpedo exploded, there was a second explosion on board, the
                reasons for which are disputed. Here you will also find material
                on the culpability of Captain Turner and much more.

              <h2>Study Smarter</h2>
              <p>
                Here the history of the Lusitania is compiled in German in index
                card form (with the option of a learning app). There are
                multiple-choice cards, an explanation of the significance and
                history, data on the ship and the passengers, a description of
                the consequences of the sinking, the political aspects and the
                influence of the sinking of the Lusitania on the outcome of the
                war. As this page is intended for students, so it provides a
                quick understanding but cannot go into as much depth as the
                archives on the left.
