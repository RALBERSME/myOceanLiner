        <p>
          We warmly welcome you to the RMS Lusitania, <br />which is in the
          service of the British Cunard Line shipping company. Today, Saturday,
          May 1st, 1915, we will leave New York at 12:20 p.m. with 1,258
          passengers and 701 crew members (a total of 1,367 men, 463 women and
          129 children) heading for Liverpool. <br /><br />You will all arrive
          safely in Liverpool on May 7th. <br /><br />We still have an hour
          before the ship sets sail. That is enough time to briefly introduce
          yourself to your fellow passengers, to make friends on board, but also
          to take a closer look at our wonderful ship. <br />We are a ship in a
          class of its own. <b>You can just scroll down or use the buttons</b>.

            <br />
            I am <em>Captain William Thomas Turner</em>.<br /><br />
            I always like to go to Liverpool, because I was born there in 1856.
            So I'm English and currently 58 years old.<br />
            My father was a captain. I've been with the Cunard Line since 1878.
            I received my captain's license in 1886 and first sailed in the
            Mediterranean. <br /><br />Despite my good nautical skills, I don't
            fit the ideal image of a Cunard captain. The shipping company
            expects me to entertain the first class passengers. But I can't
            constantly surround myself with
            <em>"a bunch of damn monkeys who are always chattering"</em>. Even
            if I seem brusque, I still understand the needs of my passengers and
            I take them seriously. <br />I steered the Lusitania in 1908, and in
            1910 I switched to its sister ship, the Mauretania, and covered the
            Liverpool - New York route in just twelve days. That was a new
            record. I've been a commodore since 1913. I then commanded the
            maiden voyage of the Aquitania. I have two sons (Percy Wilfred and
            Norman Henry), but my marriage broke up and my wife Alice moved away
            with the children.<br /><br />
            As an experienced captain, I am delighted to welcome you on
            board.<br />
            I am now getting everything ready for takeoff. I will see you in the
            saloon for dinner.<br /><br />

            I am <em>George William Beauchamp</em>.<br /><br />
            I was born in 1912 in Totton / UK. On leaving school I went to sea.
            I served on the Union Castle, the Royal Mail, and the White Star
            Lines. At the age of 24 I signed on to the Titanic as a stoker.
            Luckily I survived the disaster. <br />I escaped in Lifeboat 13, and
            was a witness at the British Board of Trade Inquiry into the loss of
            the Titanic. <br /><br />I told the enquiry that I stood on the deck
            of the Titanic by the lifeboat and helped the ladies and children
            who were there to get in. Then the officer gave the order
            <em>'Lower the boat, that's enough. Who can row?'</em> I said,
            <em>'I can.'</em> He said,
            <em>'Get in the boat. Lower the boat. That's enough.'</em> We were
            under the engine room hold. Everything went down easily until the
            boat reached the bottom, up to the hold, then we had difficulties
            keeping it away from the side of the ship. The Titanic went down bow
            first. You could hear the screams after the ship went down. It was
            terrible. We rowed with all our might which was not easy, but we
            kept rowing until we saw the light of the Carpathia, another ship of
            the Cunard Line. The Carpathia saved us. We as surviving crew
            members were brought back to England and after giving evidence to
            White Star officials, we were taken back to Southampton.<br />
            I have remained loyal to the shipping and am delighted to be working
            as a stoker on this magnificent ship today. I wish everyone a safe
            journey. But now I must get to work, otherwise we cannot set sail at
            12:20.<br /><br />

            I am 25 and a British actress of French ancestry. I am traveling
            aboard Lusitania to see my brother Alfred before he goes to fight in
            World War I. I have booked my ticket, D 1350, just this morning and
            haven`t anticipated to meet my brother-in-law George Vernon nor his
            mentor Charles Frohman aboard this ship. I am therefore looking
            forward to meeting both of them. Perhaps I will put on a little show
            in the salon... we shall see. I wish you all a relaxing journey and
            good conversations.<br />

            My name is <em>Henrietta McCulloch Carson</em>, but you can call me
            "Etta".<br /><br />
            I come from Scotland. My father James works as a coachman
            (domestic). I studied at Dumfries Academy in Scotland. I left
            Glasgow in 1911 as a second cabin passenger on the steamship Scotian
            of the Allan Line, and came to Canada where her sister (Mary) lived
            at the time (in Selkirk, Manitoba). At the age of 17 I was a student
            intending to work as a teacher in Canada and belonged to the
            Presbyterian Church.<br />
            My father had passed away in February or March 1915, and I am now
            going to Scotland to see my family there. My mother had made
            arrangements for me to sail home on the Grampian. However my older
            brother George convinced me to change ships and to sail instead on
            the Lusitania thinking it would be safer because it is faster.
            That's why I'm on board today and am looking forward to the crossing
            and arrival in England together with you.

                  >>Dearest Nellie this is just to give you the final news. I'm
                  sailing on the Lusitania which leaves New York for Liverpool
                  on May 1st. I had no intention of sailing so large a boat nor
                  of going via New York. But George thinks it is best to take
                  the fastest boat across at this time. You know Nelli that one
                  takes a great risk in crossing the ocean at any time but just
                  now the chances for getting across the ocean safely are fewer
                  still. However we are all in God's hand. And if it is his will
                  I expect I shall reach Liverpool about the 6th of May. It will
                  be great to be home again. We can see that she is travelling
                  second class and she finishes the letter. We shall soon meet
                  again. Fondest love from your loving sister.</em

            Hello! Do you know <em>Dwight Carlton Harris</em>? <br /><br />But
            you should, because that's me. As you can see, am 5'11 ½” tall, have
            blue eyes, long nose, “light and brown” hair, ruddy complexion and
            an oval face. I was born in New York City on January 6, 1884 as a
            son of a banker who died in 1903 in Manhattan. I don't have any
            brothers or sisters. I was an uncle of Henry B. Harris, who was lost
            on the Titanic. That is why I have a special life jacket made for
            myself from the sporting company Abercrombie and Fitch. It has
            special pockets for storing valuables and provided more safety than
            the standard ones. With this life jacket I really feel safe on this
            ship. LOL, ok just joking. If I didn't trust this ship, I wouldn't
            have boarded it at all. As a theatrical manager, I am on my way to
            Europe on a trip in connection with my theatrical business. I look
            forward to getting to know many of you better this evening in the
            drawing room over dinner. Have a good trip, everyone.<br />

            Hello, I'm<em>Audrey Pearl</em><br /><br />
            and because I'm only 3 months old and can't speak yet, my nanny
            Alice will speak for me. I am the 4th child of Surgeon-Major F.
            Warren Pearl and Amy Lea Duncan Pearl. Shortly after my birth, my
            father was instructed to report to the American Embassy in London.
            So we are now on our way to London. My daddy is a veteran of the
            Spanish-American war. Because of the fact that he is a sharp army
            officer he has given very specific emergency instructions to my mum
            and our two nannies how to react in emergency cases. My nanny Alice
            loves me very much and always takes good care of me and my little
            brother Stuart. I feel very comfortable with her. It's a shame that
            I'm still so small and don't get to see much of the beautiful ship
