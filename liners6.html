          Cunard Company countered the newspaper warning by assurances to you
          that the Lusitania was much too fast for U-boats, and that the British
          Navy would be taking care of this ship. They were told that Germany
          was just trying to hinder British shipping and travel.
          <br /><br />
          However the truth is that because of the war and the rise of the price
          of coal Cunard Company decided to service only three of the four
          smokestacks. That's why the Lusitania has been traveling much more
          slowly since November 21, 2014. You can also watch the video of our
          departure from New York again. There is no smoke at all coming out of
          one of the chimneys. Accordingly our top speed is cut from 25 to 21
          knots top speed and our normal speed from about 21 knots to 18 knots
          per hour.

          According to our list we transport large amount of foodstuffs. But
          something is strange. For instance why do we transport oysters, which
          have a very short shelf life, and become inedible one day after our
          planned arrival. Or is this entry on the food list just fake? Honestly
          we know that the Lusitania has military supplies on board. With each
          trip from the US to UK we are bringing new military ammunition to
          England. Weapons that the English urgently need for their defense
          against the Germans. Do you think the Germans don't know about this?
          There are rumors that there are German spies on this ship.
          <br /><br />
          So be careful who you talk to about what. We can't go back.
          <br />We're already in the middle of the high seas. I'll make you a
          strong coffee with a dash of alcohol and then you can enjoy dinner in
          the salon.
