            >“War experience has shown that fast steamers can considerably
            reduce that chance of successful surprise submarine attacks by
            zigzagging... The underwater speed of a submarine is very slow and
            it is exceedingly difficult for her to get into position to deliver
            an attack unless she can observe and predict the course of the ship
            attacked”
