            You must have enjoyed being below deck, otherwise you wouldn't have
            stayed there for so long. We're happy about that. <br />We've
            already started our last day of travel. Today is May 7th 1915, just
            after breakfast. The European mainland should soon be in sight.
            First the bays of Ireland and then we'll dock in Liverpool in the
            late afternoon.
