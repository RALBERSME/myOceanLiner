          <h1>After the Lusitania sank</h1>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          On May 7, 1915, the Lusitania sank. At that time, there were around
          1,960 people on board the ship. You will certainly be interested to
          know what happened to these people. This website is about that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the 1,960 people, only 767 survived, which corresponds to a
          survival rate of 39.1%.<br />
          1,264 of the people were passengers, the rest were part of the crew or
          band.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the journey we got to know many of these people.
          You can find out what became of them under "Personal Fates", under
          "The Prichard Letters" you will find a collection of letters
          concerning the last moments of second-cabin passenger Richard Preston
          Prichard, look at reports under "Media" and find out what became of
          the VIPs of the Lusitania.

            <em>Captain William Thomas Turner</em><br /><br />
            He stayed on the ship's bridge until the water swapped him of the
            ship. After he floated about three hours in the water, he was
            rescued. <br /><br />Serious accusations were made against him. He
            had put his ship in danger, either negligently or intentionally. He
            was said not to have sailed in the prescribed zigzag course. The
            accusations culminated in the Admiralty stating that he had been
            paid by the Germans to do so.<br />
            At the public inquiry, Turner was acquitted of all guilt. However,
            doubts about this remained and haunted him for the rest of his
            life.<br /><br />However, since there was a war and capable captains
            were needed, he was given other positions. Among other ships, he
            commanded the Ivernia, with which he was again sunk by a torpedo
            hit, although this time he had kept to the prescribed zigzag course.
            He survived this sinking too.<br /><br />
            After the war, he retired and returned to Liverpool. Winston
            Churchill's memoirs brought the war and the sinking back into the
            headlines, and the press again harassed Turner with accusations of
            guilt. <br /><br />In 1929 he fell ill with cancer and died in
            Liverpool in 1933.<br />

            Rita Jolivet had just returned to her cabin from lunch when the
            explosion occurred. She grabbed her lifebuoy, which was in her room,
            and also a pistol so that she could shoot herself and ease her pain.
            Then the Lusitania sank and she was washed overboard. She clung to a
            folding boat. She was later picked up by one of the lifeboats and
            taken to Queenstown. She continued her career as an actress.<br />
            On her deathbed (1971), her last words were “I'm only 77,” but she
            may have actually been closer to 81.

                >Dearest Nellie this is just to give you the final news. I'm
                sailing on the Lusitania which leaves New York for Liverpool on
                May 1st. I had no intention of sailing so large a boat nor of
                going via New York. But George thinks it is best to take the
                fastest boat across at this time. You know Nelli that one takes
                a great risk in crossing the ocean at any time but just now the
                chances for getting across the ocean safely are fewer still.
                However we are all in God's hand. And if it is his will I expect
                I shall reach Liverpool about the 6th of May. It will be great
                to be home again. We can see that she is travelling second class
                and she finishes the letter. We shall soon meet again. Fondest
                love from your loving sister.</em
